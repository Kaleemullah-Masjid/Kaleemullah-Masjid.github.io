                            <ul>
                              <li><strong>Justice:</strong> During his caliphate, a complaint was lodged against the governor of Egypt, Amr ibn al-As, for taking a large amount of wealth. Umar investigated the matter meticulously, and when he found the allegations to be true, he dismissed Amr from his position and ordered him to return the wealth he had taken.</li>
                              
                              <li><strong>Wisdom:</strong> Umar's decision to implement the Islamic calendar (Hijri calendar) was a wise move that helped unify the Muslim community by establishing a distinct Islamic identity separate from the previous pagan calendar. This decision continues to impact Muslims worldwide.</li>
                              
                              <li><strong>Leadership:</strong> Umar's establishment of the position of Chief Secretary (Khatib) and other administrative posts demonstrated his leadership skills. This structure streamlined communication and governance, ensuring efficient management of the expanding Islamic state.</li>
                              
                              <li><strong>Asceticism:</strong> Umar's austere lifestyle is evident in his rejection of luxury even while serving as the Caliph. He continued to wear simple clothing, use basic utensils, and live in a modest dwelling, setting an example of contentment and detachment.</li>
                              
                              <li><strong>Diplomacy:</strong> Before embracing Islam, Umar (R.A.) was sent by the Quraish as an ambassador to negotiate with other tribes. His ability to build relationships and communicate effectively is evident from his role in these diplomatic missions.</li>
                              
                              <li><strong>Courage:</strong> Umar's opposition to Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.) was marked by his determination and courage, even though he later embraced Islam. His steadfastness during those times demonstrates his unyielding character.</li>
                              
                              <li><strong>Sincerity:</strong> Umar's sincere devotion to Allah is seen in his actions, such as his early opposition to the Prophet's message. After his conversion, his commitment to the faith was unwavering, and he made decisions guided by his sincere belief in Allah's guidance.</li>
                              
                              <li><strong>Knowledge:</strong> Umar's deep knowledge and understanding of Arab history, trade, and society allowed him to make informed decisions. His insight into tribal dynamics and economic matters contributed to his successful leadership.</li>
                              
                              <li><strong>Consultative Approach:</strong> Umar's practice of shura is evident in his decision-making process. One notable example is when he consulted his companions before setting the amount of stipends given to different members of the community, showing his commitment to inclusivity.</li>
                              
                              <li><strong>Compassion:</strong> During a famine, Umar made sure that everyone, including non-Muslims, received food assistance. His concern for the well-being of all members of society, regardless of their faith, reflects his compassionate leadership.</li>
                              
                              <li><strong>Humility:</strong> Despite being the Caliph and a leader of the Islamic state, Umar (R.A.) continued to live humbly. He often walked the streets of Medina at night to assess the needs of his people and to remain connected to their lives.</li>
                              
                              <li><strong>Striving for Improvement:</strong> Umar's efforts to improve society are evident in his establishment of social welfare programs, including stipends for the poor and elderly. He set high standards for conduct, motivating others to strive for self-improvement.</li>
                            </ul>
